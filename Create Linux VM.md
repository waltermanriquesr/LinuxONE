Click on the Create a new key pair button after entering your last name

The SSH key pair created will be used to access your virtual machine

If you lose your SSH key pair, you will not be able to access your virtual machine anymore

There is no option to download the key pair again, it has been downloaded to your Downloads folder in the device you used to create the virtual machine

After clicking on the Create a new key pair button, you will see a pop-up window indicating a .pem file has been downloaded to your device

In my case, I used my last name for the key pair and my .pem file is called manrique.pem and it has been placed in the Downloads folder in my mac 

Click on the Create a new key pair button after entering your last name

After creating the key pair, make sure it is selected 

There should be a new button next to the Create and Import links 

Select your key pair button and click on the Create button at the bottom right corner of the screen

Notice there is no IP Address yet and the Status column does not display the word Active

Once the virtual machine is created you will see a green dot and the word Active in the Status column, and you will also get an IP address for your virtual machine
