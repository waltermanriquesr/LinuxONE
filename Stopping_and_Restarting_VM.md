Now, click on Stop 

If you delete your virtual machine, you will lose everything and you will have to create it again

If you choose to delete your machine, you can create it again using the same SSH key pair

After clicking stop, you will get the following pop-up

If curious, you can do that at this point since you have no work saved in your virtual machine, just be careful to follow all instructions

Click on the Confirm button to stop the instance selected

Once the virtual machine is stopped, you will see a grey square and the word SHUTOFF

You cannot use your virtual machine if the status is SHUTOFF

Letâ€™s restart it

Click on the checkbox next to the machine name and click on Start

After a few moments, the status column should display a green dot and the word Active again
